# Sign Learning Assistant

## Project Context

This project is an attempt to create a custom sign language recognition assistant, specifically for French sign language. It is primarily educational, aimed at understanding how to build and manage an AI model.

## Technical part

we use Python and Tensorflow to build a model that can recognize sign language gestures.

we use a simple frontend in the "frontend/" folder built with Vite.js and react-ts template to handle camera input and display results of the recognition done by the model.

we use base-ui as a UI library for the frontend to provide a clean and responsive design.

all code and comments should be in English to ensure consistency and accessibility for other developers.

try to answer questions in a concise and clear manner, providing examples when necessary.

when reviewing changes, focus on code quality, adherence to project guidelines, and potential improvements.
